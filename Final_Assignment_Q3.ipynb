    "### Text Document Similarity\n",
    "Create a python program that will compute the text document similarity between different docu- ments. Your implementation will take a list of documents as an input text corpus, and it will compute a dictionary of words for the given corpus. Later, when a new document (i.e, search document) is provided, your implementation should provide a list of documents that are similar to the given search document, in descending order of their similarity with the search document.\n",
    "For computing similarity between any two documents in our question, you can use the following distance measures (optionally, you can also use any other measure as well).\n",
    "1. dot product between the two vectors\n",
    "2. distance norm (or Euclidean distance) between two vectors .e.g. || u âˆ’ v ||\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of answering the question, you can also compare and comment on which of the two methods (or any other measure if you have used some other measure) will perform better and what are the reasons for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint A text document can be represented as a word vector against a given dictionary of words. So first, compute the dictionary of words for a given text corpus containing the unique words from the documents of the given corpus. Then transform every text document of the given corpus into vector form, i.e., creating a word vector where 0 indicates the word is not in the document, and 1 indicates that the word is present in the given document. In our question, a text document is just represented as a string, so the text corpus is nothing but a list of strings."
