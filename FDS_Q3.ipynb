I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\\nof my undertaking.\\n\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\\n\\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\\n\\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\n\\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\\n\\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\\n\\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\\nArchangel.\\n\\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\\nor never.\\n\\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\\nlove and kindness.\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n\\nR. Walton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 2\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\\n\\n\\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\\npossessed of dauntless courage.\\n\\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\\n\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\\nin my enterprise.\\n\\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\\notherwise he would command.\\n\\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\\n\\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\\nregions I am about to explore.\\n\\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n Robert Walton', 'The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Picture of Dorian Gray\\n    \\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\nwhatsoever.

To reveal art and\\nconceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate\\ninto another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\\nthings.\\n\\nThe highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\\nThose who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\\nbeing charming. This is a fault.\\n\\nThose who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\\ncultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\\nbeautiful things mean only beauty.\\n\\nThere is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\\nwritten, or badly written. That is all.\\n\\nThe nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\\nhis own face in a glass.\\n\\nThe nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\\nnot seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\\nthe subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\\nthe perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\\nanything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\\nethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\\nmannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\\neverything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\\nart. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\\npoint of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\\nmusician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\\ntype. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\\nsurface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\\nperil. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\\nDiversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\\ncomplex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\\nhimself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\\ndoes not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\\none admires it intensely.\\n\\nAll art is quite useless.\\n\\nOSCAR WILDE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nThe studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\\nsummer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\\nthe open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\\nperfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\\n\\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\\nlying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\\nWotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\\nblossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\\nbear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\\nthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\\nproducing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\\nthose pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\\nan art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\\nway through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\\ninsistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\\nseemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\\nwas like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\\n\\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\\nstrange conjectures.\\n\\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\\nskilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\\nface, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\\nclosing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\\nto imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\\nmight awake.\\n\\n“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\\nLord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\\nGrosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\\ngone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\\nable to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\\nI have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\\nis really the only place.”\\n\\n“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head\\nback in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\\nOxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\\n\\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\\nthe thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\\nfrom his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear\\nfellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\\ndo anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\\nyou seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\\nonly one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\\nnot being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\\nall the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\\nold men are ever capable of any emotion.”\\n\\n“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\\nit. I have put too much of myself into it.”\\n\\nLord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\\n\\n“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\\n\\n“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\\nyour rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\\nintellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\\nwhere an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\\nof exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\\nsits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\\nhorrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\\nHow perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\\nthen in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\\nage of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\\nand as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\\nYour mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\\nwhose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\\nthat. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\\nin winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\\nwhen we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\\nyourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\\n\\n“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\\nnot like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\\nlook like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\\nThere is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\\nthe sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\\nsteps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\\nat their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\\nthey are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\\nshould live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\\nneither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\\nYour rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\\nwhatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\\nfor what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\\n\\n“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.\\n\\n“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\\n\\n“But why not?”\\n\\n“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\\nnames to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\\nto love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\\nmysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\\none only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\\nam going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\\nI dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\\none’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\\n\\n“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\\nto forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\\nmakes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\\nnever know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\\nWhen we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\\ndown to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\\nmost serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\\nthan I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\\nwhen she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\\nshe would; but she merely laughs at me.”\\n\\n“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\\nHallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\\nbelieve that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\\nthoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\\nfellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\nYour cynicism is simply a pose.”\\n\\n“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\\ncried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\\ngarden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\\nstood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\\npolished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\\n\\nAfter a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\\ngoing, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”\\n\\n“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\\n\\n“You know quite well.”\\n\\n“I do not, Harry.”\\n\\n“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\\nwon’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\\n\\n“I told you the real reason.”\\n\\n“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\\nyourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\\n\\n“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\\nportrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\\nof the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\\nnot he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\\nthe coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\\nthis picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\\nmy own soul.”\\n\\nLord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\\n\\n“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\\nover his face.\\n\\n“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\\n“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\\nbelieve it.”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\\nthe grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\\nreplied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\\n“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\\nis quite incredible.”\\n\\nThe wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\\nlilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\\nlanguid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\\nblue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\\nwings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\\nbeating, and wondered what was coming.\\n\\n“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\\nmonths ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\\nartists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\\nremind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\\nwhite tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\\na reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\\nabout ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\\nacademicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\\nme. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\\nWhen our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\\nof terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\\none whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\\ndo so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\\nitself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\\nyourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\\nown master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\\nThen—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\\ntell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\\na strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\\nexquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\\nnot conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\\nno credit to myself for trying to escape.”\\n\\n“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\\nis the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\\nHowever, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\\nto be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\\nstumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\\nMr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\\n\\n“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\\npulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\\n\\n“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\\nwith stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\\nparrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\\nonce before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\\nsome picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\\nbeen chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\\nnineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\\nface to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\\nstirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\\nIt was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\\nPerhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\\nwould have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\\nthat. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\\nto know each other.”\\n\\n“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\\ncompanion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\\nguests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\\near, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\\neverybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\\nlike to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\\nexactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\\nentirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\\nto know.”\\n\\n“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\\nlistlessly.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\\nopening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\\nsay about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\\n\\n“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\\ninseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\\nanything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\\nNeither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\\n\\n“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\\nthe best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\\n\\nHallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\\nHarry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\\none; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\\n\\n“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\\nand looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\\nglossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\\nsummer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\\nbetween people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\\nacquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\\nintellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\\nhave not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\\npower, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\\nme? I think it is rather vain.”\\n\\n“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\\nmerely an acquaintance.”\\n\\n“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\\n\\n“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\\nand my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\\n\\n“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\\nrelations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\\nother people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\\nof the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\\nimmorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\\nus makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\\npoor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\\nmagnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\\nproletariat live correctly.”\\n\\n“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\\nmore, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\\n\\nLord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\\nBasil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\\nputs forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\\nnever dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\\nonly thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\\noneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\\nthe sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\\nare that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\\nwill the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\\nwants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\\ndiscuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\\nbetter than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\\nthan anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\\nHow often do you see him?”\\n\\n“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\\nabsolutely necessary to me.”\\n\\n“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\\nyour art.”\\n\\n“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\\nthink, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\\nworld’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\\nand the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\\nWhat the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\\nAntinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\\nsome day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\\nhim, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\\nmore to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\\ndissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\\nthat art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\\nand I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\\nwork, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\\nwill you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\\nnew manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\\ndifferently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\\nway that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\\nthought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\\nhas been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\\nme little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\\nvisible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\\nUnconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\\nthat is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\\nperfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\\nbody—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\\nhave invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\\nHarry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\\nlandscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\\nwhich I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\\ndone. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\\nsat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\\nfirst time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\\nalways looked for and always missed.”\\n\\n“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\\n\\nHallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\\nsome time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\\na motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\\nHe is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\\nHe is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\\ncolours. That is all.”\\n\\n“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\\n\\n“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\\nall this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\\ncared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\\nanything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\\nsoul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\\ntheir microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\\nmuch of myself!”\\n\\n“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\\nis for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\\n\\n“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\\nbeautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\\nlive in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\\nautobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\\nwill show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\\nnever see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\\n\\n“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\\nthe intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\\nfond of you?”\\n\\nThe painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\\nafter a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\\nI find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\\nbe sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\\nin the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\\nis horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\\npain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\\none who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\\ndecoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\\n\\n“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\\nof, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\\naccounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\\nourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\\nsomething that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\\nfacts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\\nwell-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\\nthoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\\n_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\\nits proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\\nyou will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\\nout of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\\nwill bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\\nhe has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\\nperfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\\nalter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\\none might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\\nthat it leaves one so unromantic.”\\n\\n“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\\nDorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\\ntoo often.”\\n\\n“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\\nfaithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\\nknow love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\\nsilver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\\nsatisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\\na rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\\nand the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\\nswallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\\npeople’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\\nseemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\\nwere the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\\namusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\\nwith Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\\nto have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\\nbeen about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\\nlodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\\nvirtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\\nThe rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\\neloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\\nall that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\\nturned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\\n\\n“Remembered what, Harry?”\\n\\n“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\\n\\n“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\\n\\n“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\\nme she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\\nin the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\\nthat she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\\nof good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\\nearnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\\ncreature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\\nabout on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\\n\\n“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“I don’t want you to meet him.”\\n\\n“You don’t want me to meet him?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\\nthe garden.\\n\\n“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\\n\\nThe painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\\n“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\\nbowed and went up the walk.\\n\\nThen he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\\nsaid. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\\nright in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\\nhim. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\\nmarvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\\ngives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\\ndepends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\\nthe words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\\n\\n“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\\nby the arm, he almost led him into the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nAs they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\\nhis back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\\n“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\\nlearn them. They are perfectly charming.”\\n\\n“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\\n\\n“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\\nmyself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\\nwilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\\nblush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\\npardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\\n\\n“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\\nhave just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\\nhave spoiled everything.”\\n\\n“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\\nHenry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\\nspoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\\nafraid, one of her victims also.”\\n\\n“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\\nfunny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\\nwith her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\\nhave played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\\nshe will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\\n\\n“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\\nAnd I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\\naudience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\\nthe piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\\n\\n“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nLord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,\\nwith his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp\\ngold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at\\nonce. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s\\npassionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the\\nworld. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\\n\\n“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too\\ncharming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened\\nhis cigarette-case.\\n\\nThe painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes\\nready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\\nremark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\\n“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\\nmoods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\\nme why I should not go in for philanthropy.”\\n\\n“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\\nsubject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\\nshall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t\\nreally mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\\nsitters to have some one to chat to.”\\n\\nHallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”\\n\\nLord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,\\nbut I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\\nOrleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\\nStreet. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\\nyou are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\\n\\n“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\\ntoo. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\\nhorribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\\nhim to stay. I insist upon it.”\\n\\n“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\\ngazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\\nam working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\\nfor my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\\n\\n“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\\n\\nThe painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\\nthat. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\\nand don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\\nsays. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\\nexception of myself.”\\n\\nDorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\\nmartyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\\nhe had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\\ndelightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\\nmoments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\\nHenry? As bad as Basil says?”\\n\\n“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\\nimmoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\\nnot think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\\nvirtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\\nsins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\\nactor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\\nself-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\\nof us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\\nforgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\\nself. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\\nthe beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\\nout of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\\nwhich is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\\nreligion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\\n\\n“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\\nboy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\\n\\n“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\\nthat graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\\nhim, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\\nwere to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\\nevery feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\\nbelieve that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\\nwould forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\\nHellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\\nmay be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\\nmutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\\nthat mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\\nthat we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\\nsins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\\npurification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\\nor the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\\nto yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\\nthe things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\\nmonstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\\nthe great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\\nbrain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\\nalso. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\\nrose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\\nthoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\\ndreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\\n\\n“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\\nto say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\\nLet me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\\n\\nFor nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\\neyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\\ninfluences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\\nreally from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\\nhim—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\\nthem—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\\nbut that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\\n\\nMusic had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\\nmusic was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\\nchaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\\nwere! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\\nAnd yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\\nto give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\\nown as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\\nso real as words?\\n\\nYes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\\nHe understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\\nseemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\\nit?\\n\\nWith his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\\npsychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\\nHe was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\\nand, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\\nwhich had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\\nwondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\\nHe had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\\nfascinating the lad was!\\n\\nHallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\\nthe true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\\nonly from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\\n\\n“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\\nout and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of\\nanything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And\\nI have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright\\nlook in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but\\nhe has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose\\nhe has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he\\nsays.”\\n\\n“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\\nreason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”\\n\\n“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his\\ndreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is\\nhorribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\\nsomething with strawberries in it.”\\n\\n“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\\ntell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I\\nwill join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been\\nin better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my\\nmasterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”\\n\\nLord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his\\nface in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\\nperfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand\\nupon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.\\n“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\\nsenses but the soul.”\\n\\nThe lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\\ntossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There\\nwas a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\\nsuddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\\nhidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\\n\\n“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of\\nlife—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\\nof the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think\\nyou know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\\n\\nDorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking\\nthe tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,\\nolive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was\\nsomething in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His\\ncool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,\\nas he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\\nBut he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been\\nleft for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil\\nHallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\\nhim. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\\nhave disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be\\nafraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be\\nfrightened.\\n\\n“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought\\nout the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\\nquite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must\\nnot allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”\\n\\n“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on\\nthe seat at the end of the garden.\\n\\n“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\\nworth having.”\\n\\n“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”\\n\\n“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\\nugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\\nbranded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\\nfeel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it\\nalways be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.\\nDon’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,\\nindeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great\\nfacts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\\ndark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be\\nquestioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of\\nthose who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t\\nsmile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That\\nmay be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\\nbeauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not\\njudge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\\nthe invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But\\nwhat the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in\\nwhich to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your\\nbeauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\\nare no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\\nmean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\\ndefeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\\ndreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\\nroses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You\\nwill suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.\\nDon’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\\nto improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\\nignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the\\nfalse ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!\\nLet nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.\\nBe afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.\\nYou might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing\\nyou could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment\\nI met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\\nof what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me\\nthat I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how\\ntragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time\\nthat your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers\\nwither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next\\nJune as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the\\nclematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\\nits purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy\\nthat beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses\\nrot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\\npassions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\\ntemptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!\\nThere is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”\\n\\nDorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell\\nfrom his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for\\na moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\\nof the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in\\ntrivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\\nus afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\\ncannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\\nsudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the\\nbee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\\nconvolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\\nfro.\\n\\nSuddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\\nstaccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and\\nyou can bring your drinks.”\\n\\nThey rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\\nbutterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\\nthe garden a thrush began to sing.\\n\\n“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”\\n\\n“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\\nWomen are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to\\nmake it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only\\ndifference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\\nlasts a little longer.”\\n\\nAs they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s\\narm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\\nflushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and\\nresumed his pose.\\n\\nLord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\\nThe sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\\nbroke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back\\nto look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that\\nstreamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The\\nheavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\\n\\nAfter about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for\\na long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\\nbiting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite\\nfinished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in\\nlong vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\\n\\nLord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a\\nwonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the\\nfinest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at\\nyourself.”\\n\\nThe lad started, as if awakened from some dream.\\n\\n“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.\\n\\n“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly\\nto-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”\\n\\n“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.\\nGray?”\\n\\nDorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\\nand turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\\nflushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,\\nas if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there\\nmotionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to\\nhim, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own\\nbeauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.\\nBasil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the\\ncharming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed\\nat them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had\\ncome Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his\\nterrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and\\nnow, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full\\nreality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a\\nday when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\\ncolourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet\\nwould pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The\\nlife that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become\\ndreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\\n\\nAs he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a\\nknife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes\\ndeepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt\\nas if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.\\n\\n“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\\nlad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.\\n\\n“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is\\none of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you\\nlike to ask for it. I must have it.”\\n\\n“It is not my property, Harry.”\\n\\n“Whose property is it?”\\n\\n“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.\\n\\n“He is a very lucky fellow.”\\n\\n“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon\\nhis own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and\\ndreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be\\nolder than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other\\nway! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was\\nto grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is\\nnothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for\\nthat!”\\n\\n“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\\nHenry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”\\n\\n“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.\\n\\nDorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You\\nlike your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a\\ngreen bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”\\n\\nThe painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\\nthat. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed\\nand his cheeks burning.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\\nsilver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till\\nI have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses\\none’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your\\npicture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth\\nis the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I\\nshall kill myself.”\\n\\nHallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,\\n“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I\\nshall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,\\nare you?—you who are finer than any of them!”\\n\\n“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of\\nthe portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must\\nlose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives\\nsomething to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture\\ncould change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint\\nit? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled\\ninto his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the\\ndivan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.\\n\\n“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.\\n\\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is\\nall.”\\n\\n“It is not.”\\n\\n“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”\\n\\n“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.\\n\\n“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.\\n\\n“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\\nyou both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\\ndone, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will\\nnot let it come across our three lives and mar them.”\\n\\nDorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid\\nface and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal\\npainting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was\\nhe doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin\\ntubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long\\npalette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at\\nlast. He was going to rip up the canvas.\\n\\nWith a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\\nHallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\\nthe studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”\\n\\n“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter\\ncoldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you\\nwould.”\\n\\n“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I\\nfeel that.”\\n\\n“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and\\nsent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked\\nacross the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of\\ncourse, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple\\npleasures?”\\n\\n“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge\\nof the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What\\nabsurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as\\na rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man\\nis many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after\\nall—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You\\nhad much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really\\nwant it, and I really do.”\\n\\n“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”\\ncried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”\\n\\n“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it\\nexisted.”\\n\\n“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\\ndon’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”\\n\\n“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”\\n\\n“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”\\n\\nThere came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden\\ntea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a\\nrattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\\nTwo globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray\\nwent over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to\\nthe table and examined what was under the covers.\\n\\n“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to\\nbe something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it\\nis only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am\\nill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent\\nengagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have\\nall the surprise of candour.”\\n\\n“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward.\\n“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth\\ncentury is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only\\nreal colour-element left in modern life.”\\n\\n“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”\\n\\n“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one\\nin the picture?”\\n\\n“Before either.”\\n\\n“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the\\nlad.\\n\\n“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”\\n\\n“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”\\n\\n“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“I should like that awfully.”\\n\\nThe painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.\\n“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.\\n\\n“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling\\nacross to him. “Am I really like that?”\\n\\n“Yes; you are just like that.”\\n\\n“How wonderful, Basil!”\\n\\n“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”\\nsighed Hallward. “That is something.”\\n\\n“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,\\neven in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to\\ndo with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old\\nmen want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”\\n\\n“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and\\ndine with me.”\\n\\n“I can’t, Basil.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”\\n\\n“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always\\nbreaks his own. I beg you not to go.”\\n\\nDorian Gray laughed and shook his head.\\n\\n“I entreat you.”\\n\\nThe lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them\\nfrom the tea-table with an amused smile.\\n\\n“I must go, Basil,” he answered.\\n\\n“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on\\nthe tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better\\nlose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.\\nCome to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“You won’t forget?”\\n\\n“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.\\n\\n“And ... Harry!”\\n\\n“Yes, Basil?”\\n\\n“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”\\n\\n“I have forgotten it.”\\n\\n“I trust you.”\\n\\n“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing. “Come, Mr.\\nGray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.\\nGood-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”\\n\\nAs the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a\\nsofa, and a look of pain came into his face.', 'The Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice\\n    \\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\nwhatsoever.

There is much more difference as\\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\\nnot want them._\\n\\n_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\\nbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\\ncause._\\n\\n_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._\\n\\n_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\\nsuperior to them._\\n\\n_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._\\n\\n_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\\neven in a black one._\\n\\n_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\\nto Addison in others._\\n\\n_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\\nare historically true._\\n\\n_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\\noutside of these four._\\n\\n_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._\\n\\n_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._\\n\\n_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\\ncharm._\\n\\n_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._\\n\\n_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\\nCruscans of this._\\n\\n_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In\\nthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\\nGrant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I\\nshould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana\\nand Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one\\nof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._\\n\\n_GEORGE SAINTSBURY._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: List of

I.]\\n\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\\ntold me all about it.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\\n\\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“He came down to see the place”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\\nin the house by the end of next week.”\\n\\n“What is his name?”\\n\\n“Bingley.”\\n\\n“Is he married or single?”\\n\\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n\\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\\n\\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\\n\\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.”\\n\\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\\nparty.”\\n\\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\\n\\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n\\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.”\\n\\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\\n\\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\\n\\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.”\\n\\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\\n\\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese twenty years at least.”\\n\\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\n\\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\nvisit them.”\\n\\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]', 'The Project Gutenberg eBook of Romeo and Juliet\\n    \\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\nwhatsoever.

Give me my long sword, ho!\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nMy sword, I say!

What, ho! You men, you beasts,\\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\\n Citizens and Servants._]\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHere were the servants of your adversary\\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\\nSo early walking did I see your son.\\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\\n\\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nGood morrow, cousin.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIs the day so young?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBut new struck nine.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nIt was.

This love that thou hast shown\\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\nFarewell, my coz.\\n\\n [_Going._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nSoft!

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\\nof my undertaking.\\n\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\\n\\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\\n\\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\n\\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\\n\\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\\n\\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\\nArchangel.\\n\\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\\nor never.\\n\\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\\nlove and kindness.\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n\\nR. Walton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLetter 2\\n\\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\\n\\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\\n\\n\\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\\npossessed of dauntless courage.\\n\\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\\n\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\\nin my enterprise.\\n\\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\\notherwise he would command.\\n\\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\\n\\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\\nregions I am about to explore.\\n\\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\\n\\nYour affectionate brother,\\n Robert Walton', 'The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Picture of Dorian Gray\\n    \\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\nwhatsoever.

To reveal art and\\nconceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate\\ninto another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\\nthings.\\n\\nThe highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\\nThose who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\\nbeing charming. This is a fault.\\n\\nThose who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\\ncultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\\nbeautiful things mean only beauty.\\n\\nThere is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\\nwritten, or badly written. That is all.\\n\\nThe nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\\nhis own face in a glass.\\n\\nThe nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\\nnot seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\\nthe subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\\nthe perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\\nanything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\\nethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\\nmannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\\neverything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\\nart. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\\npoint of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\\nmusician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\\ntype. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\\nsurface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\\nperil. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\\nDiversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\\ncomplex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\\nhimself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\\ndoes not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\\none admires it intensely.\\n\\nAll art is quite useless.\\n\\nOSCAR WILDE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nThe studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\\nsummer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\\nthe open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\\nperfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\\n\\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\\nlying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\\nWotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\\nblossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\\nbear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\\nthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\\nproducing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\\nthose pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\\nan art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\\nway through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\\ninsistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\\nseemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\\nwas like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\\n\\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\\nstrange conjectures.\\n\\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\\nskilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\\nface, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\\nclosing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\\nto imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\\nmight awake.\\n\\n“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\\nLord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\\nGrosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\\ngone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\\nable to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\\nI have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\\nis really the only place.”\\n\\n“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head\\nback in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\\nOxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\\n\\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\\nthe thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\\nfrom his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear\\nfellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\\ndo anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\\nyou seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\\nonly one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\\nnot being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\\nall the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\\nold men are ever capable of any emotion.”\\n\\n“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\\nit. I have put too much of myself into it.”\\n\\nLord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\\n\\n“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\\n\\n“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\\nyour rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\\nintellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\\nwhere an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\\nof exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\\nsits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\\nhorrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\\nHow perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\\nthen in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\\nage of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\\nand as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\\nYour mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\\nwhose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\\nthat. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\\nin winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\\nwhen we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\\nyourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\\n\\n“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\\nnot like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\\nlook like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\\nThere is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\\nthe sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\\nsteps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\\nat their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\\nthey are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\\nshould live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\\nneither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\\nYour rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\\nwhatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\\nfor what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\\n\\n“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.\\n\\n“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\\n\\n“But why not?”\\n\\n“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\\nnames to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\\nto love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\\nmysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\\none only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\\nam going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\\nI dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\\none’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\\n\\n“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\\nto forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\\nmakes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\\nnever know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\\nWhen we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\\ndown to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\\nmost serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\\nthan I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\\nwhen she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\\nshe would; but she merely laughs at me.”\\n\\n“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\\nHallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\\nbelieve that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\\nthoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\\nfellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\nYour cynicism is simply a pose.”\\n\\n“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\\ncried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\\ngarden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\\nstood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\\npolished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\\n\\nAfter a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\\ngoing, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”\\n\\n“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\\n\\n“You know quite well.”\\n\\n“I do not, Harry.”\\n\\n“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\\nwon’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\\n\\n“I told you the real reason.”\\n\\n“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\\nyourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\\n\\n“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\\nportrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\\nof the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\\nnot he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\\nthe coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\\nthis picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\\nmy own soul.”\\n\\nLord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\\n\\n“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\\nover his face.\\n\\n“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\\n“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\\nbelieve it.”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\\nthe grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\\nreplied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\\n“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\\nis quite incredible.”\\n\\nThe wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\\nlilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\\nlanguid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\\nblue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\\nwings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\\nbeating, and wondered what was coming.\\n\\n“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\\nmonths ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\\nartists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\\nremind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\\nwhite tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\\na reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\\nabout ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\\nacademicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\\nme. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\\nWhen our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\\nof terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\\none whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\\ndo so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\\nitself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\\nyourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\\nown master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\\nThen—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\\ntell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\\na strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\\nexquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\\nnot conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\\nno credit to myself for trying to escape.”\\n\\n“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\\nis the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\\nHowever, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\\nto be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\\nstumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\\nMr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\\n\\n“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\\npulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\\n\\n“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\\nwith stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\\nparrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\\nonce before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\\nsome picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\\nbeen chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\\nnineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\\nface to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\\nstirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\\nIt was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\\nPerhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\\nwould have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\\nthat. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\\nto know each other.”\\n\\n“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\\ncompanion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\\nguests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\\near, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\\neverybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\\nlike to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\\nexactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\\nentirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\\nto know.”\\n\\n“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\\nlistlessly.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\\nopening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\\nsay about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\\n\\n“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\\ninseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\\nanything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\\nNeither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\\n\\n“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\\nthe best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\\n\\nHallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\\nHarry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\\none; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\\n\\n“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\\nand looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\\nglossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\\nsummer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\\nbetween people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\\nacquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\\nintellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\\nhave not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\\npower, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\\nme? I think it is rather vain.”\\n\\n“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\\nmerely an acquaintance.”\\n\\n“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\\n\\n“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\\nand my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\\n\\n“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\\nrelations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\\nother people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\\nof the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\\nimmorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\\nus makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\\npoor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\\nmagnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\\nproletariat live correctly.”\\n\\n“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\\nmore, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\\n\\nLord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\\nBasil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\\nputs forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\\nnever dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\\nonly thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\\noneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\\nthe sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\\nare that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\\nwill the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\\nwants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\\ndiscuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\\nbetter than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\\nthan anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\\nHow often do you see him?”\\n\\n“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\\nabsolutely necessary to me.”\\n\\n“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\\nyour art.”\\n\\n“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\\nthink, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\\nworld’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\\nand the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\\nWhat the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\\nAntinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\\nsome day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\\nhim, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\\nmore to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\\ndissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\\nthat art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\\nand I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\\nwork, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\\nwill you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\\nnew manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\\ndifferently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\\nway that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\\nthought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\\nhas been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\\nme little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\\nvisible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\\nUnconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\\nthat is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\\nperfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\\nbody—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\\nhave invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\\nHarry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\\nlandscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\\nwhich I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\\ndone. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\\nsat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\\nfirst time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\\nalways looked for and always missed.”\\n\\n“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\\n\\nHallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\\nsome time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\\na motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\\nHe is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\\nHe is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\\ncolours. That is all.”\\n\\n“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\\n\\n“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\\nall this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\\ncared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\\nanything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\\nsoul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\\ntheir microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\\nmuch of myself!”\\n\\n“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\\nis for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\\n\\n“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\\nbeautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\\nlive in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\\nautobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\\nwill show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\\nnever see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\\n\\n“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\\nthe intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\\nfond of you?”\\n\\nThe painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\\nafter a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\\nI find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\\nbe sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\\nin the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\\nis horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\\npain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\\none who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\\ndecoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\\n\\n“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\\nof, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\\naccounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\\nourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\\nsomething that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\\nfacts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\\nwell-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\\nthoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\\n_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\\nits proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\\nyou will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\\nout of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\\nwill bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\\nhe has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\\nperfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\\nalter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\\none might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\\nthat it leaves one so unromantic.”\\n\\n“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\\nDorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\\ntoo often.”\\n\\n“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\\nfaithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\\nknow love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\\nsilver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\\nsatisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\\na rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\\nand the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\\nswallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\\npeople’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\\nseemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\\nwere the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\\namusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\\nwith Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\\nto have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\\nbeen about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\\nlodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\\nvirtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\\nThe rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\\neloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\\nall that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\\nturned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\\n\\n“Remembered what, Harry?”\\n\\n“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\\n\\n“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\\n\\n“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\\nme she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\\nin the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\\nthat she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\\nof good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\\nearnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\\ncreature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\\nabout on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\\n\\n“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“I don’t want you to meet him.”\\n\\n“You don’t want me to meet him?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\\nthe garden.\\n\\n“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\\n\\nThe painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\\n“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\\nbowed and went up the walk.\\n\\nThen he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\\nsaid. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\\nright in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\\nhim. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\\nmarvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\\ngives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\\ndepends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\\nthe words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\\n\\n“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\\nby the arm, he almost led him into the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nAs they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\\nhis back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\\n“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\\nlearn them. They are perfectly charming.”\\n\\n“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\\n\\n“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\\nmyself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\\nwilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\\nblush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\\npardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\\n\\n“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\\nhave just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\\nhave spoiled everything.”\\n\\n“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\\nHenry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\\nspoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\\nafraid, one of her victims also.”\\n\\n“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\\nfunny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\\nwith her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\\nhave played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\\nshe will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\\n\\n“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\\nAnd I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\\naudience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\\nthe piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\\n\\n“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nLord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,\\nwith his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp\\ngold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at\\nonce. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s\\npassionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the\\nworld. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\\n\\n“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too\\ncharming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened\\nhis cigarette-case.\\n\\nThe painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes\\nready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\\nremark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\\n“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\\nmoods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\\nme why I should not go in for philanthropy.”\\n\\n“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\\nsubject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\\nshall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t\\nreally mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\\nsitters to have some one to chat to.”\\n\\nHallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”\\n\\nLord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,\\nbut I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\\nOrleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\\nStreet. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\\nyou are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\\n\\n“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\\ntoo. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\\nhorribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\\nhim to stay. I insist upon it.”\\n\\n“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\\ngazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\\nam working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\\nfor my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\\n\\n“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\\n\\nThe painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\\nthat. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\\nand don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\\nsays. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\\nexception of myself.”\\n\\nDorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\\nmartyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\\nhe had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\\ndelightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\\nmoments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\\nHenry? As bad as Basil says?”\\n\\n“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\\nimmoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\\nnot think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\\nvirtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\\nsins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\\nactor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\\nself-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\\nof us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\\nforgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\\nself. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\\nthe beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\\nout of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\\nwhich is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\\nreligion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\\n\\n“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\\nboy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\\n\\n“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\\nthat graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\\nhim, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\\nwere to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\\nevery feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\\nbelieve that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\\nwould forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\\nHellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\\nmay be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\\nmutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\\nthat mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\\nthat we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\\nsins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\\npurification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\\nor the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\\nto yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\\nthe things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\\nmonstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\\nthe great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\\nbrain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\\nalso. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\\nrose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\\nthoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\\ndreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\\n\\n“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\\nto say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\\nLet me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\\n\\nFor nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\\neyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\\ninfluences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\\nreally from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\\nhim—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\\nthem—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\\nbut that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\\n\\nMusic had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\\nmusic was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\\nchaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\\nwere! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\\nAnd yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\\nto give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\\nown as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\\nso real as words?\\n\\nYes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\\nHe understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\\nseemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\\nit?\\n\\nWith his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\\npsychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\\nHe was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\\nand, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\\nwhich had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\\nwondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\\nHe had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\\nfascinating the lad was!\\n\\nHallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\\nthe true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\\nonly from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\\n\\n“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\\nout and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of\\nanything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And\\nI have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright\\nlook in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but\\nhe has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose\\nhe has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he\\nsays.”\\n\\n“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\\nreason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”\\n\\n“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his\\ndreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is\\nhorribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\\nsomething with strawberries in it.”\\n\\n“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\\ntell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I\\nwill join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been\\nin better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my\\nmasterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”\\n\\nLord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his\\nface in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\\nperfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand\\nupon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.\\n“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\\nsenses but the soul.”\\n\\nThe lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\\ntossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There\\nwas a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\\nsuddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\\nhidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\\n\\n“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of\\nlife—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\\nof the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think\\nyou know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\\n\\nDorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking\\nthe tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,\\nolive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was\\nsomething in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His\\ncool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,\\nas he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\\nBut he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been\\nleft for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil\\nHallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\\nhim. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\\nhave disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be\\nafraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be\\nfrightened.\\n\\n“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought\\nout the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\\nquite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must\\nnot allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”\\n\\n“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on\\nthe seat at the end of the garden.\\n\\n“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\\nworth having.”\\n\\n“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”\\n\\n“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\\nugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\\nbranded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\\nfeel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it\\nalways be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.\\nDon’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,\\nindeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great\\nfacts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\\ndark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be\\nquestioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of\\nthose who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t\\nsmile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That\\nmay be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\\nbeauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not\\njudge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\\nthe invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But\\nwhat the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in\\nwhich to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your\\nbeauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\\nare no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\\nmean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\\ndefeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\\ndreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\\nroses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You\\nwill suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.\\nDon’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\\nto improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\\nignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the\\nfalse ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!\\nLet nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.\\nBe afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.\\nYou might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing\\nyou could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment\\nI met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\\nof what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me\\nthat I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how\\ntragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time\\nthat your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers\\nwither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next\\nJune as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the\\nclematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\\nits purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy\\nthat beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses\\nrot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\\npassions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\\ntemptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!\\nThere is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”\\n\\nDorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell\\nfrom his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for\\na moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\\nof the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in\\ntrivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\\nus afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\\ncannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\\nsudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the\\nbee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\\nconvolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\\nfro.\\n\\nSuddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\\nstaccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and\\nyou can bring your drinks.”\\n\\nThey rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\\nbutterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\\nthe garden a thrush began to sing.\\n\\n“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”\\n\\n“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\\nWomen are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to\\nmake it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only\\ndifference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\\nlasts a little longer.”\\n\\nAs they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s\\narm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\\nflushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and\\nresumed his pose.\\n\\nLord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\\nThe sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\\nbroke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back\\nto look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that\\nstreamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The\\nheavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\\n\\nAfter about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for\\na long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\\nbiting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite\\nfinished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in\\nlong vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\\n\\nLord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a\\nwonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the\\nfinest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at\\nyourself.”\\n\\nThe lad started, as if awakened from some dream.\\n\\n“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.\\n\\n“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly\\nto-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”\\n\\n“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.\\nGray?”\\n\\nDorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\\nand turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\\nflushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,\\nas if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there\\nmotionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to\\nhim, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own\\nbeauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.\\nBasil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the\\ncharming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed\\nat them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had\\ncome Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his\\nterrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and\\nnow, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full\\nreality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a\\nday when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\\ncolourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet\\nwould pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The\\nlife that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become\\ndreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\\n\\nAs he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a\\nknife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes\\ndeepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt\\nas if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.\\n\\n“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\\nlad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.\\n\\n“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is\\none of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you\\nlike to ask for it. I must have it.”\\n\\n“It is not my property, Harry.”\\n\\n“Whose property is it?”\\n\\n“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.\\n\\n“He is a very lucky fellow.”\\n\\n“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon\\nhis own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and\\ndreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be\\nolder than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other\\nway! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was\\nto grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is\\nnothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for\\nthat!”\\n\\n“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\\nHenry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”\\n\\n“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.\\n\\nDorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You\\nlike your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a\\ngreen bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”\\n\\nThe painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\\nthat. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed\\nand his cheeks burning.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\\nsilver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till\\nI have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses\\none’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your\\npicture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth\\nis the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I\\nshall kill myself.”\\n\\nHallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,\\n“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I\\nshall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,\\nare you?—you who are finer than any of them!”\\n\\n“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of\\nthe portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must\\nlose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives\\nsomething to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture\\ncould change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint\\nit? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled\\ninto his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the\\ndivan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.\\n\\n“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.\\n\\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is\\nall.”\\n\\n“It is not.”\\n\\n“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”\\n\\n“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.\\n\\n“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.\\n\\n“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\\nyou both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\\ndone, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will\\nnot let it come across our three lives and mar them.”\\n\\nDorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid\\nface and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal\\npainting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was\\nhe doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin\\ntubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long\\npalette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at\\nlast. He was going to rip up the canvas.\\n\\nWith a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\\nHallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\\nthe studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”\\n\\n“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter\\ncoldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you\\nwould.”\\n\\n“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I\\nfeel that.”\\n\\n“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and\\nsent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked\\nacross the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of\\ncourse, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple\\npleasures?”\\n\\n“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge\\nof the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What\\nabsurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as\\na rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man\\nis many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after\\nall—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You\\nhad much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really\\nwant it, and I really do.”\\n\\n“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”\\ncried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”\\n\\n“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it\\nexisted.”\\n\\n“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\\ndon’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”\\n\\n“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”\\n\\n“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”\\n\\nThere came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden\\ntea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a\\nrattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\\nTwo globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray\\nwent over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to\\nthe table and examined what was under the covers.\\n\\n“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to\\nbe something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it\\nis only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am\\nill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent\\nengagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have\\nall the surprise of candour.”\\n\\n“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward.\\n“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth\\ncentury is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only\\nreal colour-element left in modern life.”\\n\\n“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”\\n\\n“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one\\nin the picture?”\\n\\n“Before either.”\\n\\n“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the\\nlad.\\n\\n“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”\\n\\n“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”\\n\\n“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“I should like that awfully.”\\n\\nThe painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.\\n“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.\\n\\n“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling\\nacross to him. “Am I really like that?”\\n\\n“Yes; you are just like that.”\\n\\n“How wonderful, Basil!”\\n\\n“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”\\nsighed Hallward. “That is something.”\\n\\n“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,\\neven in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to\\ndo with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old\\nmen want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”\\n\\n“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and\\ndine with me.”\\n\\n“I can’t, Basil.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”\\n\\n“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always\\nbreaks his own. I beg you not to go.”\\n\\nDorian Gray laughed and shook his head.\\n\\n“I entreat you.”\\n\\nThe lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them\\nfrom the tea-table with an amused smile.\\n\\n“I must go, Basil,” he answered.\\n\\n“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on\\nthe tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better\\nlose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.\\nCome to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“You won’t forget?”\\n\\n“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.\\n\\n“And ... Harry!”\\n\\n“Yes, Basil?”\\n\\n“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”\\n\\n“I have forgotten it.”\\n\\n“I trust you.”\\n\\n“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing. “Come, Mr.\\nGray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.\\nGood-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”\\n\\nAs the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a\\nsofa, and a look of pain came into his face.', 'The Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice\\n    \\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\nwhatsoever.

There is much more difference as\\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\\nnot want them._\\n\\n_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\\nbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\\ncause._\\n\\n_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._\\n\\n_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\\nsuperior to them._\\n\\n_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._\\n\\n_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\\neven in a black one._\\n\\n_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\\nto Addison in others._\\n\\n_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\\nare historically true._\\n\\n_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\\noutside of these four._\\n\\n_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._\\n\\n_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._\\n\\n_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\\ncharm._\\n\\n_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._\\n\\n_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\\nCruscans of this._\\n\\n_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In\\nthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\\nGrant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I\\nshould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana\\nand Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one\\nof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._\\n\\n_GEORGE SAINTSBURY._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: List of

I.]\\n\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\\ntold me all about it.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\\n\\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“He came down to see the place”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\\nin the house by the end of next week.”\\n\\n“What is his name?”\\n\\n“Bingley.”\\n\\n“Is he married or single?”\\n\\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n\\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\\n\\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\\n\\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.”\\n\\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\\nparty.”\\n\\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\\n\\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n\\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.”\\n\\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\\n\\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\\n\\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.”\\n\\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\\n\\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese twenty years at least.”\\n\\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\n\\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\nvisit them.”\\n\\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]', 'The Project Gutenberg eBook of Romeo and Juliet\\n    \\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\nwhatsoever.

So please you step aside;\\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\\n\\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nGood morrow, cousin.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIs the day so young?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBut new struck nine.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nIt was.

This love that thou hast shown\\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\nFarewell, my coz.\\n\\n [_Going._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nSoft!
